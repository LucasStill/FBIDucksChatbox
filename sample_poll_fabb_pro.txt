 MINT
 I have Cinnamon not GNOME
 Lol
 That changes things
 A bit
 Well, barelt
 Just different themes and stuff
 Which of these drawings represents the first assignment? Or neither of these? Because I don't really understand what they are asking for
 the second one
 actually, no
 Oh lol
 They're both wrong
 You need two stacks, one for enqueuing and the other one for dequeuing
 Waat
 so actually the second one is correct
 my bad
 Yeah, both of these drawings have that?
 when you dequeue you move everything from the first to the second stack
 So the second one?
 and I'm not going to say anything more
 Not everything, just one element?
 jk
 Are you drunk?
 no my signal is just really really slow
 Oh lol
 everything
 Oh...kay
 have you done problem2 of DSA with linked lists?
 because then it should be fairly simple
 yoyoyo Fabio, can I please get access to the dutch website?
 ?
 Sure
 Or are you supposed to do it with arrays only?
 http://nlpprogress.com/english/simplification.html
 wat is dat?
 Text simplification repo
 Might be interesting
 Haven't read it properly
 Shall we have a look at it afterwards in calculus?

 Let's visit utrecht this weekend

 Andor there's a guy on facebook called "chaffeur didi" that does transport for cheap
 lol
 wait, so are you serious or not really or...?
 I am extremely serious
 so what are you proposing then?
 I just made a short song with lmms
 could you give me some feedbacks?
 
 goed!
 are you going there tomorrow then?
 Fabio, I am not kidding, you should contact some open source game developers
 I'm having trouble installing ardour
 yeah, there might be weird stuff with the drivers and the like
 None
 are we getting tickets now?
 they're 27 euros in Antwerp and 40 euros in Utrecht

 Sure
 
 I honestly like this idea
 can you guess the time signature?
 No?

 Is it natural logarithm?
 def f(x):
	return x*np.log(x)
 ax1.plot(y, x, c='r', label='runtime')
ax1.plot(f(x), x, c='b', label='x*ln(x)')
 You need to scale the original function
 Well, at least i did
 like y%1000 ?
 and x%1000?
 x*np.log(x)/1000
 why would you divide

 Fabio, what will you be doing after the midterms?
 because literally everyone will go back home or abroad
 Let's go to Munich
 Btw, when could you pay me 30€ for the train card?
 I don't really have plans for now
 I was maybe thinking of going to Rotterdam/Groningen/Middelburg/The Hague to visit some friends ( free place to sleep)
 You could join if you want
 Whenever, you could send me your bank details or is cash better?
 Hmm, that does sound really cool, but I don't think I have the money for it tbh
 Shit. I might try working that week. Andor mentioned some freelancing work
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEHpq-BxFm4

 I've done them
 But I was bad at them lol
 But i guess i can do them again
 There is also a website for verbs
 but I forgot how it was called
 You might find the address written down in my book somewhere

 for what concert?
 (where/when)?
 https://apps.ticketmatic.com/widgets/de_roma/flow/roma?event=540505730455&l=en#!/addtickets
 I can't plan that far away in time
 How can we be sure that we won't have anything important that day?
 We'll try not to :)
 Idk
 But if we don't do it soon, there might not be any tickets left soon
 okay sure let's do it

 Are you planning on biking with me on saturday?
 My friend said that unfortunately there isn't enough space to sleep  for 2
 (for three including herself)
 hmm
 I am kinda intrigued
 then I would need to message someone who lived in Rotterdam and maybe he would recommned me someone hehe
 snarky puppy tickets
 yes?
 Shall I buy them now
 for all of us?
 nope for me
 actually I can't I need to be home
 https://goo.gl/maps/ptA7XjdYLfH2
 ?
 hmm, not sure what to do honestly
 hey, will you be able to go to TLS before going to Ella's?
 not sure
 why?
 you mentioned sth about having to stay at home?
 ?
 .
 I'll come to the party
 Can I sign it there?
 do you have a marker at home?
 yes
 a black one?
 Yes
 great!
 then I'm going home because I'm not doing work anyway
 and we can sign just before entering the house
 can you try to go to Jan Linders or AH to check for a Godiva chocolate?
 
 sure
 just a cool 7/8
 is anyone coming along?
 don't know, you could ask someone
 holy shit this is cool
 Dude, where do you get your inspiration from? Because this is literally 8bit game inspired music
 I like 8-bit sounds
 and 7/8
 Hey, are you still in Maastricht? Are you up for going to the foodbank today?
 I'd really like to but I'd rather go to sleep early because my alarm for tomorrow is at 5:30
 Oh, I see. Damn, I'd really like to join you because it sounds quite fun and don't want you to be cycling alone but this is a bit too spontaneous for me. I wouldn't have a place to sleep lol

 Check him out
 I can't rn
 I've just visited the Magritte museum in Brussels
 Uu nice mr
 Wait does OSMand have public transports?
 hmm doesn't look like it
 In their latest update
 Damn you're right
 It looks like they have even more specific ways of transport
 Than google maps
 Or maybe Google also has this
 Yup but I don't really get how it works
 hmm yeah
 it seems to work fine if I want to go to Maastricht airport with a bus
 but completely fails for Eindhoven or Aachen
 have you checked out this guy?
 https://youtu.be/mZRb0FyAa9s
 I'll do it later today
 alright
 I have just now
 
 (not a huge fan)
 lol
 I don't dislike it, I just find it a bit too simplistic
 simplistic? In what sense?
 But maybe I'm just not in the right mood right now
 Few and simple sounds, few and simple cords and rythms
 *chords
 hmm
 What's his best song?
 how much have you checked out? Because he has a ton of sounds, perhaps the chords aren't very sophisticated but he has a Master's in percussion so his rhythms aren't simplistic by any means. He often plays polyrhythms and the like
 hmm, probably best example imo would be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfpSn7ZYC0A
 but I really like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiUx3n3S1EI 9:40 also
 What do you think of this?
 interesting but definitely too jolly for my tastes
 although maybe I'm also in a specific mood
 when are you coming back to Maas?
 Tomorrow evening
 Great
 You lost your UM card AND this is happening? You're on a roll, Fab

 That's fine Costanza is organising it and she told me that they're still missing a band
 Hmmm

 Yeah, sure
 Just get the pliers
 And any other tools you think would be useful
 Gloves would be nice
 Ok
 Alright I'm done where are you?
 
 damn sounds nice
 now I want to develop this
 Fabsteeer I need to study calc
 but now I will take my bass
 hey
 can you send me a link or sth to a meditation for stress?
 because I think my average sleep time for the last 2 weeks is 5hrs
 I wouldn't care about it still but I don't want to be a total wreck for the exams
 
 
 
 Where does the square root 4-x^2 come from?
 pythagoras?
 Then what about the 2
 earlier you have the substitution
 x = 2sin(theta)
 then you express sin as follows:
 sin(theta)  = x/2
 Oooh
 That's cool
 Thanjs
 and basically this means in the triangle
 x is in front of the angle and 2 is the hypotenuse
 have you done anything for DSA yet? My plan for today is do one of the exams
 Oi
 Not really
 Ben jij en fiets?
 am I and bicycle?
 yeah, are you?

 Oi, when are you going to Brussels?
 And can I join or is it too late? The train has gone off? Left me at the station?
 Oi
 You can still join! My mom bought food for more than just me
 I was thinking of leaving tomorrow in the early afternoon
 Hmm wouldn't you like to go to the foodbank though? Ella is still here and Andor would join
 Hum
 Sooo?
 Idk
 Would it be fine for you if we leave today?
 Tbh I really want to go to the foodbank as Andor would be joining. How would it be different if we leave today rather than tomorrow?
 Tomorrow rather than today*
 Ehh, I was thinking that I will go to the foodbank today and meet with Andor so I guess I might not go to Brussels then :/ there's also a party at the LBB tomorrow
 I think I'll leave today
 At around 15
 Will you come with me today? Or would you join tomorrow?
 Hmm. Definitely not today. Tomorrow I'm most likely going to the party at the LBB here since quite a few people are interested. Chris is coming with you today?
 Sooo I'm probably not going to Brussels at all this weekend then :/  sorry for such a weird change of plans, that's what happens when planning is done spontaneously lol
 Call me when you have the chance, I have another idea
 https://goo.gl/maps/47uzeyqEsAv
 So do you plan on coming tomorrow?
 Yeah, in the morning with nick
 at what time?
 Do you already know what you'd like to visit?
 We'll leave at 8 hopefully
 At we'll be there at 10
 And not sure what we'll visit
 We'll sort it out on our way there
 I need to cut my hair between 13-16:15
 Shall we meet at the museum of instruments at 10:30?
 Wher u at?
 unpaywall
 I have the following doubts:
- How to properly draw backtrack and forward-check showing stopping points
- How to convert multiple variables to CNF (like ∀x p(x) ∧ ∀y p(y))
- How to insert variables where you have functions with resolution (P(Dog)  --  P(x) ∧ ¬P(f(x)))
- How to draw variable that depends on two but is unable to distinguish between the two (see Task 4 exam 1)
 
 I have no idea for task 1 of the second practice exam
 
 tf?
 wtf?
 Which one is it?
 I'll be coming home soon
 task 2 b
 I'm at Ella's
 Idk
 (Julian made it last year, not all of it is correct)
 what did you get in task 4
 the last question in c?
 I thought P(B | C) = P(B) = 9/20
 Second exam?
 first
 P(B|C)=P(B^C)/P(C)
Denominator by LOTUS
And numerator is P(B|S)P(S)+P(B|~S)P(~S)+...
 what is that first line?
 the hell is P(B^C)?
 Wait wait
 And
 ohh
 and are they independent
 ?
 Yeah so doesn't that simplify to P(B)P(C)?
 yea
 Wait I think I'm wrong
 can you send me your solutions? I get 0.45 this way
 
 Nick's answer
 ding ding ding spanish question marks spotted lol
 ¿Qué?
 what the hell is Julian's proof for task 1b in second exam?
 do you have a shorter answer?
 Yeah idk
 Nick and Walter have different answers
 I asked Chris
 oh shit
 in cnf
 if you have an AND, you can just list it as a separate fact?
 so not A ^ B but
 1. A
2. B
 Yeah
 oof
 so what's the conclusion of task 1?
 Exam 2?
 Julian's answer explains that nicely
 he skips 1 a) and b) is weird
 1a is the same as assignment 1 first question
 How do you render md in firefox?
